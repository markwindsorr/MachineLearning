## Data Types

To analyze data, we need to know which type of data we are working with. We can split the data types into 3 main categories:

1. Numerical

* Discrete Data - finite values (ex. Test score, )
* Continuous Data - infinite values (ex. Price of an item)

2. Categorical 

* Values that cannot be measured up against each other. Example: A color value, a car type, 

3. Ordinal 

* Like Categorical data but can be measured up against each other. Example: School grades ... D is better than F, C is better than D, B is better than C and so on.
