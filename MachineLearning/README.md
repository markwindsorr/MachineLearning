"A computer program is said to learn from experience E with respect to some class of tasks T and a performance measure P, if its performance at tasks T, as measured by P, improves with experience E" - Tom M. Mitchell

In other words:

"An agent is learning if it improves its performance on future tasks after making observations about the world"

# Overview

## Specify Type of Problem (Supervised vs Unsupervised Learning)

Given a machine learning problem, first we need to determine if it is a supervised or unsupervised learning problem. 

#### Supervised Learning

***Supervised learning*** if used when our training dataset has an attribute (a column) that contains the "answer", usually called the target or ground truth. The dataset that contains the target attribute is called "labeled" data.

#### Unsupervised Learning

***Unsupervised learning*** is used when we do not have labeled data. The machine learning model is expected to learn the underlying patterns

#### Semi-supervised

***Semi-supervised Learning*** is when we have some labeled data but most of it is unlabeled. We can then use a mixture of supervised and unsupervised learning techniques.

### Specify Type of Model (Classification vs. Regression)

We further have to distinguish the machine learning model as classification or regression based on what we want to output.

If the output of the machine learning model is a discrete value (non-continuous such as a boolean value), we call it a ***classification model***. 

If the output of the machine learning model is a continuous value, we call it a ***regression model***.
