"A good understanding of linear algebra is essential for understanding and working with many machine learning algorithms, especially deep learning algorithms."

## Math Objects used in Linear Algebra

***Scalars*** are just a single number. An element of a field which is used to define a vector space. Examples of scalars include volume, density, speed, energy, mass and time. Other quantities such as force and velocity have a magnitude and a direction which are called vectors

***Vectors*** are an array of numbers and are arranged in order. We can identify each element by its index. We can think of vectors as identifying points in space, with each element giving the coordinate along a different axis.

***Matrices*** a 2-D array where each element is identified by two indices instead of one.

***Tensors*** In cases where we need an array with more than two axes. In general, an array of numbers arranged on a regular grid with a variable number of axes is known as a tensor.
